/**
 * A wrapper around a value which is loaded based on the output from the provided
 * {@link RegistryLoader}. This class is primarily designed to hold a registration
 * of some kind, however no limits are set on what it can hold, as long as the
 * specified RegistryLoader returns the same value type that is specified in the
 * generic.
 *
 * <p>
 * Below, a RegistryLoader is taken in the constructor. RegistryLoaders have two
 * generic types: the input, and the output. The input is what it takes in, whether
 * it be a string which references to a file, or nothing more than an integer. The
 * output is what it generates based on the input, and should be the same type as
 * the {@link M} generic specified in the registry.
 *
 * <p>
 * Registries can be very simple to create. Here is an example that simply parses a
 * number given a string:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *     public static final SimpleRegistry<Integer> STRING_TO_INT = SimpleRegistry.create("5", Integer::parseInt);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a simple example which really wouldn't have much of a practical use,
 * however it demonstrates a fairly basic use case of how this system works. Typically
 * though, the first parameter would be a location of some sort, such as a file path
 * where the loader will load the mappings from. The NBT registry is a good reference
 * point for something both simple and practical. See {@link MappingRegistries#BIOME} and
 *
 * @param <M> the value being held by the registry
