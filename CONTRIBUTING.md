## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the project, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/PowerNukkitX/PowerNukkitX/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/PowerNukkitX/PowerNukkitX/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/PowerNukkitX/PowerNukkitX/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See "[Label reference](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/label-reference)" for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

  1. Fork the repository.
    - [Fork the repo](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/fork-github-projects.html#fork)
    - [Clone your fork](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/manage-projects-hosted-on-github.html#clone-from-GitHub)
  2. Install **JDK21**.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

  - Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
  - Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
  - Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
    Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
  - We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
  - As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
  - If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
