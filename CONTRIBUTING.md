# 贡献帮助指南
 Hi，我们很高兴见到您对[PowerNukkitX](https://github.com/blocklynukkit/powernukkitx)项目所表现出的热情，我们 的目标是为所有参与开发的参与者们提供一个良好的协作环境，因此我们决定列出一些在此过程中需要您牢记的事情，以下指南是根据过往经验总结而成的。

 但您需注意，这些规则本身不是"**官方规则**"，但您若遵循它们将帮助参与者们提高处理效率。

## 目录

## <a id="目录-问题#1"></a>我想提交一个问题!

 我们随时欢迎您提出任何问题，错误报告和功能建议，但请记住，如果该问题在可预期的时间点内被认定为不重要，无法解决等，我们也会将其忽略，因此Issues页面可能会出现长时间未解决或彻底关闭的问题反馈将会是正常情况。

* **在提交问题报告前，请您搜索现有问题列表。**

  出于管理目的，我们会关闭与先前就存在的问题反馈，避免产生重复，推荐您先通过自行搜索的方式查询是否存在类似问题。

* **在提交问题报告时请尽可能的尝试提供更多详细信息。**

 由于产生的错误信息各不相同，其中一部分错误在几乎所有设备上都能遇到，而有一部分是因为某些特定情况甚至是硬件本身导致，所以我们推荐您在提交问题时提供尽可能多且详细的信息，以下为示例模板：

  * 服务器的日志文件（若服务器可用时），您则可用通过以下方式获取日志文件：
    * `/debugpaste upload`
    * `[您的服务端所在文件夹]/logs/latest.log`
  * 你的设备规格参数 (包括您客户端的类型，操作系统平台，服务器硬件参数等),
  * 重现步骤 (您在遇到BUG之前进行了什么操作等),
  * 如果可以的话，请提供视频或截图加以辅助。

* **当被要求提供更多有关信息时。**

  Sometimes when a bug is more elusive or complicated, none of the information listed above will pinpoint a concrete cause of the problem. In this case we will most likely ask you for additional info. Providing that information is beneficial to both parties - we can track down the problem better, and hopefully fix it for you at some point once we know where it is!

* **提交改进意见时，请以简单易懂的方式描述它。**

  有时传达您对某个功能的想法通常很困难，我们希望避免产生任何误解，因此，您在提交改进建议时，尽量使用简洁易懂的话语或方式描述您的想法。

* **避免发布"+1"重复问题。**

  如果问题已经产生，并且你也遇到过但无法提供任何对我们有帮助的问题细节的话，那您可在相关问题下评论留言。

We also welcome pull requests from unaffiliated contributors. The [issue tracker](https://github.com/blocklynukkit/powernukkitx/issues) should provide plenty of issues that you can work on; we also mark issues that we think would be good for newcomers with the [`good first issue`](https://github.com/blocklynukkit/powernukkitx/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agood%20first%20issue) label.

Here are some key things to note before jumping in:

* **Make sure you are comfortable with Java and your development environment.**

  While we are accepting of all kinds of contributions, we also have a certain quality standard we'd like to uphold and limited time to review your code. Therefore, we would like to avoid providing entry-level advice, and as such if you're not very familiar with Java as a programming language, we'd recommend that you start off with a few personal projects to get acquainted with the language's syntax, toolchain and principles of object-oriented programming first.

* **Make sure you are familiar with git and the pull request workflow.**

  [git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that might not be very intuitive at the beginning if you're not familiar with version control. In particular, projects using git have a particular workflow for submitting code changes, which is called the pull request workflow.

  To make things run more smoothly, we recommend that you look up some online resources to familiarise yourself with the git vocabulary and commands, and practice working with forks and submitting pull requests at your own pace. A high-level overview of the process can be found in [this article by GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests).

  We also provide a [handy link](https://powernukkit.org/pr) for making pull requests to PowerNukkit: `https://powernukkit.org/pr`.

* **Make sure to submit pull requests off of a topic branch.**

  As described in the article linked in the previous point, topic branches help you parallelise your work and separate it from the main `bleeding` branch, and additionally are easier for maintainers to work with. Working with multiple `bleeding` branches across many remotes is difficult to keep track of, and it's easy to make a mistake and push to the wrong `bleeding` branch by accident.

* **Add tests for your code whenever possible.**

  Automated tests are an essential part of a quality and reliable codebase. They help to make the code more maintainable by ensuring it is safe to reorganise (or refactor) the code in various ways, and also prevent regressions - bugs that resurface after having been fixed at some point in the past. If it is viable, please put in the time to add tests, so that the changes you make can last for a (hopefully) very long time.

* **Run tests before opening a pull request.**

  Tying into the previous point, sometimes changes in one part of the codebase can result in unpredictable changes in behaviour in other pieces of the code. This is why it is best to always try to run tests before opening a PR.

  Continuous integration will always run the tests for you (and us), too, but it is best not to rely on it, as there might be many builds queued at any time. Running tests on your own will help you be more certain that at the point of clicking the "Create pull request" button, your changes are as ready as can be.

* **Make sure that the pull request is complete before opening it.**

  Whether it's fixing a bug or implementing new functionality, it's best that you make sure that the change you want to submit as a pull request is as complete as it can be before clicking the *Create pull request* button. Having to track if a pull request is ready for review or not places additional burden on reviewers.

  Draft pull requests are an option, but use them sparingly and within reason. They are best suited to discuss code changes that cannot be easily described in natural language or have a potential large impact on the future direction of the project. When in doubt, don't open drafts unless a maintainer asks you to do so.

* **Only push code when it's ready.**

  As an extension of the above, when making changes to an already-open PR, please try to only push changes you are reasonably certain of. Pushing after every commit causes the continuous integration build queue to grow in size, slowing down work and taking up time that could be spent verifying other changes.

* **Make sure to keep the *Allow edits from maintainers* check box checked.**

  To speed up the merging process, collaborators and team members will sometimes want to push changes to your branch themselves, to make minor code style adjustments or to otherwise refactor the code without having to describe how they'd like the code to look like in painstaking detail. Having the *Allow edits from maintainers* check box checked lets them do that; without it they are forced to report issues back to you and wait for you to address them.

* **Refrain from continually merging the master branch back to the PR.**

  Unless there are merge conflicts that need resolution, there is no need to keep merging `bleeding` back to a branch over and over again. One of the maintainers will merge `bleeding` themselves before merging the PR itself anyway, and continual merge commits can cause CI to get overwhelmed due to queueing up too many builds.

* **Refrain from force-pushing to the PR branch.**

  Force-pushing should be avoided, as it can lead to accidentally overwriting a maintainer's changes or CI building wrong commits. We value all history in the project, so there is no need to squash or amend commits in most cases.

  The cases in which force-pushing is warranted are very rare (such as accidentally leaking sensitive info in one of the files committed, adding unrelated files, or mis-merging a dependent PR).

* **Be patient when waiting for the code to be reviewed and merged.**

  As much as we'd like to review all contributions as fast as possible, our time is limited, as team members have to work on their own tasks in addition to reviewing code. As such, work needs to be prioritised, and it can unfortunately take weeks or months for your PR to be merged, depending on how important it is deemed to be.

* **Don't mistake criticism of code for criticism of your person.**

  As mentioned before, we are highly committed to quality when it comes to the project. This means that contributions from less experienced community members can take multiple rounds of review to get to a mergeable state. We try our utmost best to never conflate a person with the code they authored, and to keep the discussion focused on the code at all times. Please consider our comments and requests a learning experience, and don't treat it as a personal attack.

* **Feel free to reach out for help.**

  If you're uncertain about some part of the codebase or some inner workings of the game and framework, please reach out either by leaving a comment in the relevant issue or PR thread, or by posting a message in the [development Discord server](https://www.powernukkit.org/discord). We will try to help you as much as we can.

  When it comes to which form of communication is best, GitHub generally lends better to longer-form discussions, while Discord is better for snappy call-and-response answers. Use your best discretion when deciding, and try to keep a single discussion in one place instead of moving back and forth.
